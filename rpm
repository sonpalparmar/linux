 RPM packages typically have file names like foo-1.0-1.i386.rpm. The file name includes the package name (foo), version (1.0), release (1), and architecture (i386). 
To install a package, log in as root and type the following command at a shell prompt:
                                         rpm -ivh foo-1.0-1.i386.rpm

    i –install   
   v – verbose
   h - hash
Upgrading a package is similar to installing one. Type the following command at a shell prompt:
    
        rpm -Uvh foo-2.0-1.i386.rpm

As part of upgrading a package, RPM automatically uninstalls any old versions of the foo package. Note that -U will also install a package even when there are no previous versions of the package installed.
